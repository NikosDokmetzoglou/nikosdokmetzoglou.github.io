We have established the closure of the <a href=\"https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2207.14806\">SO(2,n) Yangian<\/a> algebra for a differential operator representation in momentum-space, by proving that the Serre relation is satisfied for both scalar and gauge fields, in their respective domains of applicability. We have also studied the action of the SO(2,n) Yangian generators on the tree-level scattering amplitudes of scalar \u03bb \u03d5<sup>3<\/sup> theory and pure Yang-Mills theory; two non-supersymmetric field theories which are intimately related through the Cachazo-He-Yuan scattering equations formalism. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To facilitate my research, I have made extensive use of Mathematica and its computer algebra capabilities. I have developed Mathematica packages for symbolically calculating the action of the conformal SO(2,n) Yangian generators on the above mentioned scalar and gauge theory tree amplitudes, and also for numerically evaluating those using finite fields methods, i.e. using modular arithmetic with large prime numbers. I plan on publishing these packages on my <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/NikosDokmetzoglou\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">GitHub<\/a> profile, for use by the rest of the scattering amplitudes community.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:30%\">\n<p>You can find a list of my publications at :<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1520-8758\" target=\"_blank\">ORCID<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/inspirehep.net\/authors\/1808352\">INSPIRE<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/arxiv.org\/search\/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Dokmetzoglou%2C+N\" target=\"_blank\">arXiv<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/scholar.google.com\/citations?user=Mh00PQwAAAAJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Scholar<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/nikosdokmetzoglou.github.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/SymmetryGraph.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-119\" width=\"947\" height=\"844\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I am interested in the various symmetries characterizing certain scalar and gauge field theories, and the ways those often manifest themselves as hidden mathematical properties of their scattering amplitudes.
